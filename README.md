# CI Simulation Project

## Abstract

This project simulates a basic Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for software development. It includes a simple Python codebase with a main module, a supporting module, and associated tests. The project aims to showcase the principles of CI, including linting and automated testing.

## Introduction

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and integrated into the project repository. This project demonstrates a simplified version of a CI pipeline, emphasizing linting and testing processes.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:
- To provide a hands-on experience with CI concepts.
- To showcase the importance of automated linting and testing in software development.

## Approach

The project follows these steps:
1. **Linting:** The code is checked for adherence to coding standards and best practices.
2. **Testing:** Automated tests are run to ensure the functionality of the code.
3. **Simulation:** The CI pipeline is simulated using a shell script.

## Underlying Concepts

The project covers the following concepts:
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automated process of integrating code changes into the project.
- **Linting:** Static analysis to check code for style, errors, and potential issues.
- **Automated Testing:** Executing predefined tests automatically to verify code functionality.

## Definitions

- **Linting:** The process of analyzing code for potential errors, style violations, and adherence to coding standards.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** A development practice where code changes are automatically tested and integrated into the main codebase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ci-simulation.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd ci-simulation
    ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate"
    ```

4. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the CI Simulation

```bash
./ci_simulation.sh
